# Game-Of-Life

## By: Nishchal Agrawal

## Description 
This is a visualization of Conway's Game Of Life, coded in Python. It is meant to be viewed in the command prompt. Unix terminals would most likely work, but I have only tested the code on Windows. 

## Instructions
There are a couple of variables you can change to make the visualization work better on your system.

### mapX and mapY
These variables affect the size of the grid for the visualization. The visualization works best when the grid fills up the entire command prompt window.

### initNum
This variable holds the number of alive cells that will be randomly spawned in when the visualization starts. A good value for this is around 10-20% of the number of total cells in the grid (in my experience)

### clearDelay
Essentially, this variable defines the number of seconds that each generation will be visualized before it is cleared for the next generation. The lower this number, the higher the "frames" per second
